            On March 19th, 1938, the Socialist Appeal, the Official Weekly Organ of the Socialist Workers Personality
            published the phrase, <b>Lenin's General Staff of 1917 - Stalin the Executioner Alone Remains</b>. While this phrase
            is used as socialist critique, this expression portrays Joseph Stalin's rise to power. Stalin, the dominant and concentrating
            power in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, ruled with an Iron Fist and eliminated any possible opponents through removing,
            marginalizing, or executing. Under the photo of each member of the Bolshevik Central Committee of 1917, is the fate under Stalin's 
            reign of terror.

            Preceding Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev stunned the communist world with his “Secret Speech,”
            titled “On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences.” Of the many criticisms, Khrushchev's disdain
            for Stalin's harsh ruling highlighted the failure of the mass purges and usage of repression and terror
            as a method of control. Khrushchev's speech pushed new measures of relaxing repression and censorship
            that undermined every corner of Soviet life with de-Stalinization. Entering the Cold War, Khrushchev
            believed that the Soviet Union and the USA's opposing ideologies could coexist peacefully. Rather than
            racing towards armament, Khrushchev insisted on racing towards space or the greater standard of living.
