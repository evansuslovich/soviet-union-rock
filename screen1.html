            On March 19th, 1938, the Socialist Appeal, the Official Weekly Organ of the Socialist Workers Personality
            published the phrase, <b>Lenin's General Staff of 1917 - Stalin the Executioner Alone Remains</b>. While this phrase
            is used as socialist critique, this expression portrays Joseph Stalin's rise to power. Stalin, the dominating
            power in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, ruled with an Iron Fist and eliminated opponents, being regular citizens, politicians, or artists.
            Under the photo of each member of the Bolshevik Central Committee of 1917, is the fate under Stalin's 
            reign of terror.

            After Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev emerged as his successor, becoming the leader of the Soviet Union. In 1956, Khrushchev stunned the communist world with his “Secret Speech” titled “On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences.” Among his many criticisms, Khrushchev denounced Stalin's oppressive rule, highlighting the failures of mass purges and the use of repression and terror as tools of control. This speech marked the beginning of de-Stalinization, as Khrushchev introduced reforms to relax repression and censorship, which profoundly reshaped Soviet society.
            Amid the Cold War, Khrushchev championed the idea that the Soviet Union and the United States, despite their opposing ideologies, could coexist peacefully. Rather than prioritizing an arms race, he advocated for advancements in space exploration and improving the standard of living.
