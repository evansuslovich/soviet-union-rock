            “On October 10th, there was the first concert of the Moscow group Time Machine in our city … It was the first time that a rock group became liked on a national level and approached the popularity of Galich or Vysotsky. It looked like 'Machine-mania.' And for good reason. The music, lyrics, voices, and instrumentation were so good that it was impossible to listen with indifference. Andrei Makarevich was so fascinating and musical that it was impossible not to adore him … Time Machine became the symbol of its time, a symbol of everything romantic and pure.” (Soviet Rock: 25 Years in the Underground + 5 Years of Freedom, pp. 35-36)

                   Mashina Vremeni (Time Machine) holds the distinction of being the Soviet Union's first major rock band, initially formed in 1968 as a Beatles-inspired ensemble. Andrei Makarevich, the band's founder, was a young musician from a privileged background; his father, a successful Moscow architect, inadvertently set the wheels in motion for the band when he returned from a business trip to the West with a copy of A Hard Day’s Night. Upon hearing the album, Makarevich experienced a transformative moment that forever altered the course of his life, a sentiment echoed by countless other Soviet youths who found themselves captivated by the energy and emotion of Western rock music (pg. 59, Rock around the Block: A History of Rock Music in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union).

                     Makarevich and Mashina Vremeni distinguished themselves by merging the narrative-driven ethos of bard songs with the dynamic language of rock. Unlike traditional bards, who relied on simple melodies and acoustic arrangements, Makarevich infused his work with electrified instrumentation and the stylistic flair of Western rock. His stilted delivery and nasal voice became hallmarks of the band's sound, as he delved into existential themes and reflections on the passage of time. Remarkably, despite the politically charged environment of the Soviet Union, Makarevich managed to remain apolitical, focusing instead on universal human experiences (Music and Word, pg. 209).

                     Through their innovative approach, Mashina Vremeni not only captured the imagination of Soviet audiences but also laid the groundwork for the evolution of rock music in the Eastern Bloc. The band's ability to adapt Western influences to the unique cultural context of the USSR cemented their legacy as trailblazers in the region's music history.
